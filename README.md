# CV Page Made With HTML & CSS
## About me
I'm a student of FICE of Kyiv Politechic Institute in Ukraine.
I studied Python, Java, HTML & CSS, C, C#, etc. I'm addicted to creating something
new on my own, so that's the reason I created
this project - to become a Fullstack Developer.
## About Project
This project is considered as my CV, so I could show my 
knowledge and web developing skills. All the projects, stores, etc.
 shown here aren't real and have nothing to do with the
real stores and companies. They are used to show the 
web dev skills and design knowledge only.
## Usage
Although this project is my CV, you're welcome to use it
however you want. I'd be glad you do. No rights are reserved
